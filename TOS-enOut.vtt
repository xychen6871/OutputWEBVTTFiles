You're a jerk, Thom.

00:00:24.991 --> 00:00:26.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look Celia, we have to follow our passions;

00:00:26.993 --> 00:00:30.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
...you have your robotics, and I
just want to be awesome in space.

00:00:30.797 --> 00:00:34.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why don't you just admit that
you're freaked out by my robot hand?

00:00:34.501 --> 00:00:36.002 line:57% position:48% align:center
I'm not freaked out by- it's...

00:00:37.003 --> 00:00:37.937 line:59% position:41% align:start
...alright! Fine!

00:00:38.004 --> 00:00:40.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
I'm freaked out! I have nightmares
that I'm being chased...

00:00:41.007 --> 00:00:42.008 line:41% position:35% align:center
...by these giant robotic claws of death...

00:00:42.208 --> 00:00:45.011 line:11% position:42% align:center
"Fourty years later"
Whatever, Thom. We're done.

00:00:50.016 --> 00:00:53.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
Robot's memory synced and locked!

00:01:00.994 --> 00:01:02.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is pretty freaky.

00:01:56.983 --> 00:01:58.985 line:89% position:56% align:center
Shouldn't you be down there?

00:02:10.997 --> 00:02:12.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
I heard you guys talking last night.

00:02:16.002 --> 00:02:18.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
It's not my fault, you know.

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.991 line:11% position:23% align:center
Are you ready?

00:03:12.992 --> 00:03:14.994 line:61% position:35% align:center
Of course you're ready, you're a rockstar.

00:03:16.996 --> 00:03:17.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
How's it looking, Barley?

00:03:18.998 --> 00:03:21.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
We should have about ten minutes...

00:03:21.501 --> 00:03:23.002 line:77% position:69% align:center
Well that's perfect.

00:03:23.503 --> 00:03:26.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
We're on in one! All systems go!
Yeah you, go!

00:03:28.007 --> 00:03:32.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
Go! Move your asses! Go go go!

00:03:33.012 --> 00:03:36.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
I love it! Come on, go!

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:43.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
That's nice.

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:45.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nothing to worry about.

00:03:45.992 --> 00:03:46.993 line:89% position:17% align:end
Thom.

00:03:50.997 --> 00:03:52.999 line:11% position:81% align:center
There she is.

00:03:53.499 --> 00:03:54.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now.

00:03:55.001 --> 00:03:56.002 line:11% position:20% align:center
You love her.

00:03:57.003 --> 00:03:58.504 line:71% position:64% align:end
She is your passion!

00:04:00.006 --> 00:04:01.007 line:90% position:11% align:start
Be tender to her.

00:04:01.507 --> 00:04:04.510 line:85% position:38% align:center
Be honest! Eh- be tender.

00:04:05.011 --> 00:04:08.014 line:82% position:38% align:center
Remind her what love is.

00:04:51.991 --> 00:04:54.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
...and, action!

00:04:56.496 --> 00:04:57.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
Memory overwrite in progress!

00:04:58.998 --> 00:05:01.000 line:32% position:25% align:start
You're a jerk, Thom!

00:05:02.502 --> 00:05:05.004 line:63% position:11% align:start
Ohp- Sorry! Sorry.

00:05:16.015 --> 00:05:16.983 line:11% position:65% align:start
Look Celia.

00:05:17.984 --> 00:05:19.986 line:11% position:48% align:center
We have to follow our passions.

00:05:20.987 --> 00:05:22.989 line:90% position:38% align:center
You have your robotics...

00:05:24.991 --> 00:05:27.994 line:25% position:35% align:center
...and I just want to be awesome in space.

00:05:39.005 --> 00:05:41.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
Okay, they're coming. Two minutes left!

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:44.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
Speed it up, Thom!

00:05:45.011 --> 00:05:46.012 line:11% position:21% align:start
Vivacissimo!

00:05:47.013 --> 00:05:50.016 line:60% position:45% align:center
Why don't you just admit that you're
freaked out by my robot hand?

00:05:55.988 --> 00:05:58.991 line:90% position:45% align:center
Listen Celia, I was young...

00:05:59.492 --> 00:06:00.927 line:11% position:56% align:start
...and a dick.

00:06:00.993 --> 00:06:02.995 line:90% position:35% align:center
But that's no reason to
destroy the world.

00:06:04.997 --> 00:06:05.998 line:57% position:64% align:end
Why does he do this?

00:06:06.499 --> 00:06:08.501 line:90% position:19% align:start
We already tried that one!

00:06:11.504 --> 00:06:12.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
Abort!

00:06:13.005 --> 00:06:13.940 line:11% position:11% align:center
Cut!

00:06:14.006 --> 00:06:15.007 line:11% position:11% align:center
Whoaaa!

00:06:19.011 --> 00:06:20.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
Whoaaa!

00:06:21.013 --> 00:06:22.949 line:11% position:11% align:center
Nooooo!

00:06:23.015 --> 00:06:24.984 line:11% position:29% align:center
You broke my heart.

00:06:25.985 --> 00:06:26.919 line:84% position:11% align:center
I know.

00:06:26.986 --> 00:06:28.921 line:90% position:66% align:center
You forgot me on earth.

00:06:28.988 --> 00:06:29.989 line:90% position:11% align:center
I know.

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:32.992 line:83% position:38% align:center
I should just crush you.

00:06:35.995 --> 00:06:36.996 line:11% position:51% align:start
I'm-

00:06:47.006 --> 00:06:48.007 line:11% position:69% align:start
I'm sorry.

00:06:50.009 --> 00:06:51.010 line:11% position:81% align:center
Good ad-lib.

00:06:58.985 --> 00:07:00.486 line:84% position:20% align:center
Not my fault!

00:07:01.988 --> 00:07:02.989 line:41% position:17% align:center
This time.

00:07:07.994 --> 00:07:09.495 line:11% position:20% align:center
Quiet on set!

00:07:09.996 --> 00:07:10.997 line:81% position:29% align:center
We're out of time!

00:08:12.992 --> 00:08:13.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
Come on!

00:08:22.001 --> 00:08:23.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
RAAAAAAAAH!

00:08:24.003 --> 00:08:25.004 line:90% position:11% align:start
Memory overwrite, 90%.

00:08:26.005 --> 00:08:28.007 line:88% position:82% align:end
Captain! We have to abort!

00:08:37.984 --> 00:08:39.986 line:90% position:56% align:center
The world's changed, Celia...

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.002 line:85% position:32% align:center
...maybe we can too.

00:08:58.004 --> 00:08:59.005 line:30% position:11% align:start
Memory overwrite complete!

00:09:18.991 --> 00:09:19.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know.

00:09:21.994 --> 00:09:23.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
There's a lesson to be learned from this.

00:09:25.998 --> 00:09:26.999 line:11% position:29% align:center
Could'a gone worse.
