Why won't anyone...

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.000 line:86% position:78% align:center
...look at the big picture?

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.000 line:24% position:47% align:start
What I'm going to tear down
is this world--its very framework!

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.500 line:87% position:44% align:start

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000 line:25% position:62% align:end
...the one small girl in front of me...

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000 line:83% position:66% align:start
...how can I become...

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.000 line:72% position:78% align:center
...a hero who saves everyone?
