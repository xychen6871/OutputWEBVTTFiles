00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.250 line:11% position:55% align:start
Today, we'll be playing 
Mario Golf: Advance Tour

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.000 line:88% position:81% align:center
For this round,
we'll be using Gene.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
Gene used to be called
"The King of Birdies"

00:00:09.999 --> 00:00:13.370 line:11% position:76% align:center
...and was once the 
champion of the Links Club.

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:16.000 line:11% position:76% align:center
Unfortunately for him,
he lost that title to Kid.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.690 line:11% position:39% align:start
Right now, his stats 
are unremarkable.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000 line:11% position:39% align:start
His drive isn't really
that great (250 yds).

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.000 line:11% position:39% align:start
His swing control and
impact are a bit weak.

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:28.000 line:11% position:38% align:start
His only real strength 
is his above-average spin.

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:31.306 line:11% position:38% align:start
But Custom Clubs can help
improve his effectiveness.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000 line:11% position:38% align:start
We'll play on the
Star Links Course. 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.420 line:11% position:38% align:start
9 random holes
from the back tee. 

00:01:20.121 --> 00:01:25.250 line:11% position:38% align:start
So far so good...

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:46.372 line:11% position:76% align:center
Holy shit! I did not expect
that to happen.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.250 line:11% position:39% align:start
We're off to a
 pretty good start!

00:01:57.316 --> 00:02:00.250 line:11% position:38% align:start
Better safe than sorry...

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.260 line:11% position:38% align:start
Probably shouldn't have
used backspin TBH.

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.360 line:11% position:39% align:start
Close, but no cigar. 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:20.320 line:13% position:39% align:start
Good thing Gene's timing
was on point.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.337 line:13% position:38% align:start
Ugh, this is gonna be a pain.

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:40.000 line:13% position:38% align:start
Gene's shot trajectory is
obstructed by obstacles.

00:04:12.133 --> 00:04:15.240 line:13% position:48% align:start
Unsurprisingly, the ball 
didn't land on the green.

00:04:20.024 --> 00:04:27.003 line:13% position:48% align:start
Thankfully, Gene still
salvaged a birdie.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000 line:11% position:36% align:start
Goddamnit.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.400 line:11% position:38% align:start
Third time's the charm.
Huh.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000 line:11% position:38% align:start
That's the 3rd time Gene got
 a birdie with a chip-in.

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.432 line:11% position:38% align:start
Goddamn...
Gene's on a roll right now.

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:41.271 line:11% position:44% align:start
Four birdies in a row and a
goddamn eagle on his 1st hole.

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:56.720 line:11% position:38% align:start
Landing on a heath...
not a good thing...

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:21.065 line:11% position:38% align:start
Too bad the birdie streak's
gonna end on this hole.

00:06:45.392 --> 00:06:47.262 line:11% position:38% align:start
Good thing the ball still 
landed on the fairway...

00:07:29.287 --> 00:07:31.288 line:11% position:38% align:start
This could be trouble...

00:07:40.288 --> 00:07:44.200 line:89% position:77% align:center
At this point, Gene's not
going to get an eagle
for this hole.

00:07:55.217 --> 00:07:58.195 line:11% position:38% align:start
But a birdie is still possible.

00:08:12.018 --> 00:08:20.800 line:11% position:38% align:start
Final Score: -8
A very good round for Gene.
